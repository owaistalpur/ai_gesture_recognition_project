# Gesture Recognition Project
This project is a continuous motion recognition system that can detect and classify harry potter wand movements. This project utilised an MPU6050 accelerometer to gather movement data and Edge Impulse to train and deployment the model on the Nucleo-F401RE development board. 

Using the accelerometer data, the model can identify the following spells:
1. __Incendio__
2. __Reparo__
3. __Aguamenti__
4. __Serpensortia__
5. __Expelliarums__

Below is an image that shows the various wand movements. <img width="954" height="1231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a974c09-57bc-49e1-b53b-0968725c80af" />
